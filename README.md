# Module 1 Challenge

## Refactor the code to meet the customers Acceptance Criteria, and accessibilty needs.

this repository contains my first weeks assigment. Refactoring and making an exsisting code more accessible. I used multiple sematic HTML elements
to help condense and make code more discoverable for serach engines. Using multiple elements, attributes, and selectors to better the code. This project challenged me through my first weeks learning, however it proved the importance of sematic HTML and CSS on any site.
